Feature: Multilingual features
  In order to easily understand the content of the European Commission
  As a citizen of the European Union
  I want to be able to read content in my native language

  Background:
    Given the following languages are available:
      | languages |
      | en        |
      | fr        |
      | de        |
    # The following two steps will not be necessary after NEXTEUROPA-5948
    # gets in, then they can (and should) be removed.
    And "page" content type supports field translation
    And URL language suffix negotiation is enabled

  Scenario: Content can be translated in available languages
    Given I am viewing a multilingual "page" content:
      | language | title            |
      | en       | Title in English |
      | fr       | Title in French  |
      | de       | Title in German  |
    And I should see the heading "Title in English"
    And I should see the link "Français"
    And I should see the link "Deutsch"
    When I click "Français"
    And I should see the heading "Title in French"
    When I click "Deutsch"
    And I should see the heading "Title in German"

  Scenario: Custom URL suffix language negotiation is applied by default on new content.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role
    And I am viewing a multilingual "page" content:
      | language | title            |
      | en       | Title in English |
      | fr       | Title in French  |
      | de       | Title in German  |
    # Clicking on "View" will invalidate URL alias cache allowing
    # URL suffix negotiation to correctly modify the URL.
    # We should find a way to make this step not necessary.
    And I click "View"
    Then I should be on "content/title-english_en"
    When I click "Français"
    Then I should be on "content/title-english_fr"
    When I click "Deutsch"
    Then I should be on "content/title-english_de"

  Scenario: Enable multiple languages
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role
    When I go to "admin/config/regional/language"
    Then I should see "English"
    And I should see "French"
    And I should see "German"

  Scenario: Enable language suffix and check the base path
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role
    When I go to "admin/config/regional/language/configure"
    And I check the box "edit-language-enabled-nexteuropa-multilingual-url-suffix"
    And I uncheck the box "edit-language-enabled-locale-url"
    And I press the "Save settings" button
    Then I should see the success message "Language negotiation configuration saved."
    When I go to "admin/config/regional/language/edit/en"
    And I fill in "edit-prefix" with "en-prefix"
    And I press the "Save language" button
    And I go to "admin/config/system/site-information"
    And I fill in "edit-site-frontpage" with "admin/fake-url"
    And I select "01000" from "edit-classification"
    And I press the "Save configuration" button
    Then I should see the success message "The configuration options have been saved."
    And the cache has been cleared
    And I should not see "admin/fake-url" in the ".form-item-site-frontpage span.field-prefix" element
    And I should not see "en-prefix" in the ".form-item-site-frontpage span.field-prefix" element
