  Scenario Outline: Test feature set screen as administrator
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I am on "admin/structure/feature-set_en"
    Then I should see the text "<feature_name>"

    Examples:
      | feature_name                          |
      | Content slider                        |
