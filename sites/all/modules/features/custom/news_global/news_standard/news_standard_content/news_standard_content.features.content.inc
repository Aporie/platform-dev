          'value' => '<p class="A___35__20_Normal">Brussels, 29 February 2012 &ndash; The European Commission has today proposed decisive action to meet three key challenges facing our society, in areas that are crucial to growth and jobs: the supply of raw materials, sustainable agriculture, and active and healthy ageing. All three require a more concerted innovation effort across the public and private sector, in order to improve quality of life and position Europe as a global leader. The Commission has therefore launched two new European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs) - on Raw Materials and on Agricultural Sustainability and Productivity - and has endorsed a four-year action plan for the Active and Healthy Ageing EIP, a pilot launched in February 2011. EIPs take a new approach to tackling the whole research-development-innovation chain, bringing together public and private stakeholders across borders and sectors in order to accelerate the uptake of innovation. They each have an ambitious target to reach by 2020, and are expected to start delivering results within 1-3 years. The announcement today comes just ahead of a European Council that is expected to reaffirm the place of research and innovation at the centre of European economic recovery.</p>
  <p class="A___35__20_Normal">The President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, said: <span class="A__T1">&quot;We need to innovate to get Europe back on the path to growth and jobs, and to tackle major challenges such as access to raw materials, sustainable agriculture and our ageing society. European Innovation Partnerships will break down silos, remove bottlenecks and focus our efforts on results that matter to our citizens and our businesses.&quot;</span></p>
  <p class="A___35__20_Normal">The European Innovation Partnership (EIP) is a new concept that was introduced in the Europe 2020 flagship Innovation Union. The aim is to address weaknesses, bottlenecks and obstacles in the European research and innovation system that prevent or slow down good ideas being developed and brought to market. These include under-investment, outdated regulation, lack of standards, and fragmentation of markets. Each Partnership is led by a Steering Group chaired by the European Commissioner or Commissioners with responsibility for the policy area or areas concerned. They are joined by representatives of Member States (Ministers), Members of Parliament, industry leaders, researchers, civil society and other key stakeholders. EIPs identify what needs to be done to overcome bottlenecks &ndash; from further developing technologies to getting the market frameworks right and stimulating demand &ndash; and galvanise action across public and private sectors. They do not replace funding programmes or regulatory processes, but provide a shared platform for cooperation.</p>
  <p class="A_Sous-titre_20_1_P8">Innovation partnership to overcome Europe&#39;s raw materials shortages</p>
  <p class="A___35__20_Normal">The supply of raw materials, the lifeblood of today&#39;s high-tech industry, is increasingly under pressure. With a view to increasing Europe&#39;s own production, under the proposal to set up a European Innovation Partnership on raw materials, joint innovation efforts will support exploration, extraction and processing of raw materials. For example, it has been estimated that the value of unexploited European mineral resources at a depth of 500-1,000 metres is about &euro; 100 billion. New technologies will help to extract deeper, in more remote areas and under harsh conditions. Action is also needed to develop substitutes for critical raw materials and to improve recycling of electric, electronic equipment and other waste. Improved access to minerals will enhance the development of innovative products such as thin photovoltaic layers, energy-efficient lighting, electric cars, advanced passenger jets, infra-red optics and fiber glass.</p>
  <p class="A___35__20_Normal">Vice-President Antonio Tajani, responsible for Industry and Entrepreneurship said: <span class="A__T1">&ldquo;We need to join forces to tap Europe&#39;s enormous own potential of raw materials. Intensified action is required to make Europe the world leader in the capabilities related to exploration, extraction, processing, recycling and substitution by 2020. It will be the key to Europe&rsquo;s ability to develop today the technologies of tomorrow. Such innovation is decisive for Europe&#39;s competitiveness, sustainable growth and new jobs.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="A_Standard_Sous-titre_20_1">European Innovation Partnership for agriculture</p>
  <p class="A___35__20_Normal">Food security is one of the major challenges worldwide in the years ahead, with global food demand forecast to rise by 70% by 2050 (FAO), accompanied by a steep increase in the demand for feed, fibre, biomass, and biomaterial. However, this challenge is accompanied by a slow down in productivity growth &ndash; in good part because of a reduction in investment in agricultural research &ndash; and increased pressure on the environment and our natural resources. For example, 45% of European soils face problems of soil quality. Around 40% of agricultural land is vulnerable to nitrate pollution and, over the last 20 years, farmland birds have declined by 20-25%.</p>
  <p class="A___35__20_Normal">In short, the key challenge for agriculture in future is not only to produce<span class="A__T8"> more</span>, but also to do this in a <span class="A__T8">sustainable </span>manner. These challenges will not be resolved without a major push towards embracing research and innovation &ndash; and in particular in bringing researchers, farmers and other players closer together so that we can accelerate the speed of technological transfer from science to farming practice, and provide more systematic feedback about practice needs from farming to science. The European Innovation Partnership (EIP) &quot;Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability&quot; aims to provide a working interface between agriculture, bio-economy, science, and others at EU, national and regional level. It will also serve as a catalyst to enhance the effectiveness of innovation-related actions supported by Rural Development Policy as well as the Union Research and Innovation. Two headline targets have been identified for this EIP - <span class="A__T9">promoting productivity and efficiency</span> of the agricultural sector (reversing the recent trend of diminishing productivity gains by 2020); and the <span class="A__T9">sustainability of agriculture</span><span class="A__T10"> </span><span class="A__T9">(securing soil functionality*</span> at a satisfactory level by 2020).</p>
